Installation and data requirements

1) Install Anaconda (Python 2.7) from:  https://www.continuum.io/downloads
This includes python 2.7.9 and the necessary libraries we will be using: "numpy", "matplotlib", "scipy" and "scikit-learn"

2) Installing required packages using "pip"

Open your terminal and check whether you have the "pip" function installed by typing pip (and enter)
If you do not have pip installed, check the link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/
You may need to use "sudo pip install" (for OSX, *nix, etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to be able to perform the installation of the folllowing individual packages:

(sudo) pip install Plotly
(sudo) pip install keras
(sudo) pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git

If you already have any of the previously-mentioned libraries installed, you can update them to a newer version using the syntax: 

pip install <package> --upgrade

where <package> can be any of the libraries mentioned above.


3) Installing required packages with "conda"

Once more in your terminal run: 

conda install opencv

If the opencv/cv2 library does not load and gives you an error while in step 8, you may want to try this newer version:

conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv


4) Install git if you don't have it: http://git-scm.com/


5) Sign up for a GitHub account or sign in if you have one: https:// github.com


6) Fork the CCA bootcamp repository at: 

https://github.com/cambridgecoding/machinelearningbootcamp.git


7) Download the following file (may take some time) and place it in the day2 folder  

VGG16 weights (500MB) from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz7KyqmuGsilT0J5dmRCM0ROVHc/view

8) Open and run the "load_libraries.ipynb" file, wait for the pre-fetching of the CIFAR10 dataset to be completed (it may take a while but a progress bar will show you the remaining time) and check whether the libraries have been successfully loaded.
